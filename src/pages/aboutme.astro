          I'm Yehezkiel Gunawan, a front-end engineer. You can call me Yehez.
          Mostly, I use React and its libraries while working in its ecosystem.
          To sharpen my understanding of something, I usually push myself to
          craft some projects and publish them here. Sometimes, I write some
          blogs to share my experience, testimonies, or tips & tricks as a
          frontend developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides of programming things, I like to explore some new tech stuff,
          playing games sometimes, visit cosplay event, photography (using my
          Sony a6000), and watching animes. Oh by the way, if you don't mind,
          you can support me through Github Sponsor or Mayar.id to keep this
          site alive and maintained.
        </p>
